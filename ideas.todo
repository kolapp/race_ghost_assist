you need to know
	where your player's car is in the race (cp progrses)
	where your ghost's car is in the race (harder ghost car harder, it doesn't collect cps)


retrieve all the x,y,z's of the cps

search for the first node within distance of collecting cp1

if so then everything up until that node is part 1
then run through your node list and search for the first node that is within distance of collecting cp2
if so then everything up until that node is part 2
etc
during the race check at which cp your player's car is and retrieve all nodes from that part
then get the node that is nearest to the player
that way you have the right node heading for the right cp that is closest to your player
after that you can draw as many nodes ahead as you want


the hard part will be dividing the nodes in parts as different types of checkpoints have different types of ways of collecting them
a normal checkpoint collects if you are at the right x and y, a corona or cylinder collects if you are at the right x y and z
although some nodes might even overlap while being in the same part, heading for the same cp
imagine a race where you start at the bottom floor, drive 100km ahead and have to turn around, go up a ramp and drive 100km back to finish just above the start(edited)
that way the script will always pick the wrong node at some point, there is no way in making it good

- fenn lehet egy monotonit�st tartani
	- a nearby node-ok k�z�l a node_id v�ltoz�s pozit�v �s minim�lis legyen az el�z�h�z k�pest --> tal�n nem t�r �t m�sik �tvonalra
	- last_node -1-r�l indul --> �gy nem lehet f�lremenni a verseny elej�n
	- next_node id az el�z�n�l csak nagyobb lehet
